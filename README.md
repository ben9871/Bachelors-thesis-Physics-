A pdf of my thesis "A machine learning approach to the simulation of bio-inorganic compounds" sits here. The existing software programs used throughout were LAMMPS, AMBER, ORCA and FITSNAP. Python and some shell scripting was used to process LAMMPS dump files and lay the results out in graphical form.
